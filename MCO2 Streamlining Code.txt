- controller prompts the user to give input
- view takes input, passes data into controller
- controller calls the necessary function for such a feature



+ make items indiv objects
+ create more (and smaller) object classes
+ split all menus into callable functions

renzo note: create comprehensive overview of the view; methods and major processes of the view such as user inputs through buttons and text fields, reflecting information from the controller into panels,
and 
search designs and formatting for the vending machine and images/vectors for each of the items. sold out items must be shown to be empty. 
there must be two GUIs, one for the factory and one for the vending machine.
